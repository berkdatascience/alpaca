# Agar Enhanced

This project is a simplified web-based game inspired by **Agar.io** with additional features such as abilities and optional game modes. It provides a small framework to expand upon with more mechanics.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

## Features

- Basic growth mechanic: eat pellets to gain mass.
- Player abilities: speed boost and shield.
- Simple free-for-all mode with a looping game arena.

The code is intentionally small and can be extended to implement more complex mechanics such as capture the flag or king of the hill.
